              </TypographyTitle>
              <p className='fs-16 text-justify'>In the quiet moments of motherhood, while her children slept, Kannupriya's kitchen became an
                alchemist's laboratory. What started as a pursuit of the perfect entremet evolved into a vision for
                transforming India's patisserie landscape. Her journey wasn't marked by formal culinary training,
                but by something equally valuable—an unwavering dedication to mastery and an intuitive
                understanding of how food brings people together.
                Kannupriya's strength lies in her ability to see beyond the conventional. Where others saw just a
                vacant storefront, she envisioned a haven where traditional craftsmanship could flourish
                alongside modern innovation. Her entrepreneurial spirit is matched only by her commitment to
                community building and ethical sourcing.
                As Vision Director, Kannupriya has crafted more than just a patisserie—she's created a
                movement. Her focus on empowering women in culinary arts, supporting local farmers, and
                preserving traditional craftsmanship has transformed Copper & Crumb into a beacon of
                sustainable luxury in the food industry.</p>
